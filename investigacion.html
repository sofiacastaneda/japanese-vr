        <p>The bubble machine that we created provides person-to-person and person-to-space interaction. The machine has a iris mechanism that varies its outlet size reacting to the participant's speech pattern as if it tries to talk something. Once the participant pauses, the machine blows out various sizes of bubble. The floating bubble represents the subtle state of a message from interpersonal communications that lies in the middle of real and digital world. Also, it creates a certain delay until it pops, which is a metaphor of our behavior that we often delay to send out text-messages through chatting apps. We believe that anyone can be an artist. By open sourcing the details of fabrication process and materials, we want to encourage people to build the machine, interact with it at any locations, and use and modify it as a art tool for realizing their own ideas whether it is for art or not.</p>

      <p>First, the ephemeral (i.e., transient) is a natural phenomenon that yields potential for application in HCI but that has not yet been thought of as part of reality-based interaction [2].</p>
      <p><strong>ephemerality as a design concept</strong>
        has the potential to address the problem of cognitive overload due to the huge amount of data that gets represented in ubiquitous computing systems nowadays. This also leads to the question of how ephemerality can be designed into the digital.</p>
      <p>Ephemerality is an important aspect of human life</p>
      <p> People generally love the ephemeral as an event and a sen- sation, for example, in the form of performances or fireworks. When something is there for only a lim- ited time, experiencing it is special.</p>
      <p>Important for regarding something as an artistic material
        in this broader context of con- temporary art is the existence of certain meanings of the material
        in a cultural context, as well as the evocation of a specific, often multi- sensory perception of the material. Even fire, air, or light can be regard- ed as materials of art if used in a meaningful way.</p>
      <p>An interaction material can be any material that is used in a meaningful way for the interaction, that has certain mean- ings in a cultural context, and that evokes a multisensory perception. Here, we are specifically interested in ephemeral interaction materials.</p>
      <p>We define ephemeral user inter- faces as “a class of user interfaces that contain at least one UI ele- ment that is intentionally created
        to last for a limited time only. The durability of the UI element is determined by its intrinsic material properties in combination with its surrounding ecosystem. While their ephemeral UI element(s) exist(s), ephemeral user interfaces pro-
        vide a rich and multisensory user experience. They may deliberately be designed to offer only partial or imperfect user control” [5].</p>
      <p>Ephemeral UI elements are characterized by two important features. First of all, they are time- based. This means that parts of the interface are designed not to last. How long they last varies depending on their material, their surrounding ecosystem, and what determines their disappearance or degradation. Ideally, the disappear- ance of UI elements fits the intend- ed interaction with the interface and its user experience. This could be due to the fact that UI elements are needed for only a short time
        or that users should be engaged in destroying them and creating new ones. UI elements might also disap- pear to simply raise attention or to limit the user’s mental load by pre- senting information unobtrusively in the background for a limited time. With ephemeral user interfac- es, temporality becomes part of the meaning of the interaction.</p>
        <p>A sec- ond focus of ephemeral UI elements lies on the qualities and aesthetics of the materials used for interac- tion. </p>
      <p>ephemeral user interfaces contain materials that carry special embed- ded meanings from other contexts, often ones deeply inscribed into the cultural context of their users </p>
      <p> In our design space, we focus on three aspects of ephemeral UIs: materials for ephemeral UI elements, interaction, and ephemerality </p>
      <p>One relevant aspect of materials for user interfaces is the purpose of their selection.</p>
      <p>the properties of a certain material—for example, its physical, mechanical, electrical, optical, eco-, thermal, or acoustic properties—led to its usage within a user interface. </p>
      <p>material semantics—a material's meaning, history, and typical ways of use in a certain cultural context or environ- ment. </p>
      <p>This yields the potential to cluster interaction techniques based on the states of matter.
        Interaction. We distinguish between interfaces where the ephemeral material is used for output only, those that use the ephemeral material for input only, and those that use one ephemeral material for both input and output.</p>
      <p>These UIs receive their input either from a com- puter or from a user. If the input comes from a computer system,
        it can either involve no interac- tion by users—for example, when displaying digital information—or include implicit interaction—input based on tracked human behav- ior, often without the users real- izing this. In a further category, ephemeral materials are used for output and the system allows user input, but the input and output spaces are not the same (indirect interaction). The next class of user interfaces uses ephemeral materi- als for input only</p>
      <p>UIs that use ephemeral materi- als for input and output ideally unify the input and output space and often are realized by gestural interaction with and projections onto ephemeral materials</p>
      <p>Ephemerality. One of the charac- teristics of ephemeral user inter- faces is that parts of the UIs are not designed to last. This leads to two design parameters: first, how the disappearance or degrada- tion of ephemeral UI elements is
        determined, and second, the class of durability of ephemeral UI ele- ments.</p>
      <p>We identified three different mecha- nisms: natural phenomena (e.g., gravitation, phase transformation, disappearing sunlight, bubbles that naturally burst), user interaction (e.g., bursting a bubble by touch- ing, eating food), and system trig- ger (e.g., as applied in ferrofluid interfaces). </p>
      <p>(flexible durability). Ice is an example of a material that can last forever if the temperature is low enough but that can also melt from one moment to another.</p>
      <p>HCI commu- nity: First, design tools for material- focused user interfaces is a promising research direction to elaborate on the physical materials’ aspects and meanings for interaction. Second, ephemeral smart materials focuses on the application of novel and artifi- cial materials for interaction. And third, as natural materials and tan- gible interaction are not necessar- ily suitable for all user interfaces, nature and ephemerality as metaphor for hardware and software design forms another strand of research.</p>
      <p>material-focused interaction vocabulary for ephemeral UIs</p>
      <p>toolkits that support the integra- tion of a variety of different materi- als for interaction.</p>
      <p>this would most likely lead to much richer textures for interac- tion and an integration of the fasci- nating phenomena nature offers.</p>
      <p>reality-based interaction that suggests starting to think from real-world phenomena when designing interaction</p>

Our method improves the controllability of soap bubble simulation by correcting the jerky hand trajectory and hand velocity to a smooth and gradual path. Our air flow transfer algorithm can produce detailed deformation and standing wave for soap film in real time. Our novel soap film bursting algorithm represents the process of the bursting phenomenon of soap-film and giant soap bubbles in a unified framework. The results of our experiment demonstrate that the system allows the user to experience the giant soap bubble blowing and bursting process in a virtual environment.</p>

[3] introduced a method to simulate the formation of giant soap bubbles by using the varying surface tension with Gibbs-Marangoni elasticity. These previous studies focused on developing algorithms that handle the physical and geometrical characteristics of soap films and soap bubbles, whereby the motion of the blowing tool was simulated with a manual input or fixed state. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient method is available that allows users to experience the blowing and bursting of 3D soap bubbles by their motions.</p>

                    <p>Many physics-based modeling techniques have been presented to simulate the air effects of soap bubble and cloth. A study that simulates the interaction of a wind field with a lightweight deformable object including soap bubble has been proposed [10], but it did not consider the air effect inside the soap bubble. The inflatable model [15], in which air is inflated inside the deformable surface, has been proposed, but it focused on the air pressure inside the deformable surface and did not consider air flow. The giant soap bubble creation model [3] has been proposed, but it treated air effect as air pressure based on Young Laplace’s law. Chen et al. [16] proposed an efficient technique that realistically simulates air effects between cloth and a deformable object based on Darcy’s law and the air transfer method. However, these previous studies that deal with air effects of the soap bubble and cloth did not take into account the air flow inside the giant soap bubble.</p>

      <p>From childhood, we often play with bubbles. We find various aes- thetic elements in a series of actions of soap bubbles: appearing, ex- panding, floating, bursting and disappearing. This time, we utilize the movements of soap bubbles as a pixel of an image and propose a novel interactive substantial display named “Shaboned Display.” <br><br>
        Mainly in the field of media art, many artists and designers have also used bubbles as a tool for expression. However, in most of the previous systems, bubbles float freely and randomly in air. For example, in “Bubble Cosmos [Nakamura et al. 2006]”, participants can interact with projection images by breaking floating bubbles with white smoke. “ephemeral melody [Suzuki et al. 2008]” also use bubbles as an interface. In this piece, musics are created ac- cording to the collisions of bubbles floating randomly. On the other hand, our Shaboned Display can show images by controlling the size of each soap bubble arranged in a matrix in a plane. As for the substantial displays, various types of material have also applied to construct visual images. One of the features of such display sys- tems is that each pixel has a physical form and we can touch them freely. In our system, we can use each soap bubble not only as a pixel of a display but also an input tool. By exploding the soap bubbles, the displayed images change interactively.</p>

        <p>This paper proposes a bubble display system (Fig.1) that projects
          an image onto a real bubble containing smoke and changes the
          sound effect and image when the bubble bursts. This system
          enables a user to interactively enjoy written characters or other
          images projected onto a smoke-containing bubble, and a beautiful
          tone sounded upon bursting of a bubble, along with a different
          image projected onto the smoke. To detect a bubble and determine
          its bursting, a camera input image is divided into areas and each
          area is checked for a bubble. The bubble position and size are also
          detected, and an image is projected from a projector.</p>
          <p>By using a smoke-containing bubble as a screen, this system can
            produce a visual effect never before available. Since an image is
            not projected onto the surface of a bubble but onto smoke
            contained in the bubble, the image appears to be inside the bubble.</p>
